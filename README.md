## About the Project

![Project mockup](acnh_generator_mockup.jpg)

During quarantine, I (like many others) got into playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons. One of the biggest issues I face in this game is creating a name for my island. Islands can only have ten characters and can be a big decision since you can't change it and it can reflect the overall theme of your island. So, I go to the internet for name suggestions. However, a lot of generators are boring and not pleasing to look at, so I wanted to make a more appealing interface.

I sourced names for this generator from a Tumblr post from Angie's Town. To build the logic of the generator, I used HTML inputs to toggle word categories and JavaScript to randomly generate a name up to ten characters. Once the overall logic was working, I turned to Figma to create a simple prototype of how the interace will feel.

Future improvements are to design and develop responsive layouts while still keeping the overall Animal Crossing design.
